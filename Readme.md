# Mongodb-Aggregation-And-Indexing

## Module-1 : Introduction to powerful aggregation framework

#### What is Aggregation?
- Aggregation is a way of processing a large number of documents in a collection by means of passing them through different stages.
- The stages make up what is known as pipeline
- The stages in a pipeline can filer,sort, group, reshape and modify documents that pass through the pipeline
- Syntax
```javascript
db.collection.aggregate(
    [
        // stage-1
        {} --->pipeline
        // stage-2
        {} --->pipeline
        // stage-3
        {} --->pipeline
    ]
)
``` 
- Data flow : Collection -> Stage1 -> Stage-2 -> Stage-3 -> Final Output

- Rough Example
```javascript
db.cousins.aggregate([
    // filter out the cousins who have exam
    {$match : {hasExam : {$ne :true}}},

    // Filter out cousins who have a budget less than 5000
    {$match :{budget : {$gte :5000}}},

    // filter out cousins who is sick
    {$match : {isSick :true}},

    // sort by age
    {$sort :{age:-1}},

    // limit by 2 
    {$limit :2},

// calculate budget
{
    $group :
    {
        _id:"null",
        totalBudget : {$sum : "$budget"},
        cousins : {$push : "$name"}
    }
}
])
```
